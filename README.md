# Project: Investigate a Dataset - People who didn't show up for medical appointments in Brazil

> This project aims to investigate a dataset containing information about 100k medical appointments in Brazil and focuses on the question of whether or not patients showed up for their appointments. The dataset includes various characteristics of the patients and the appointments, such as the patient's age, gender, neighborhood, whether they have certain ailments, whether they received an SMS appointment reminder, and whether they are enrolled in the Brazilian welfare program Bolsa FamÃ­lia. The main goal is to identify factors that might be important in predicting if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.

## Question(s) for Analysis
The dataset seeks to answer the question: What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

## Conclusions
> The conclusions drawn from the analysis are as follows:

> 1. Age seems to have an effect on the rate of appointments missed. The higher the age, the more appointments are kept.
> 2. Gender also has a relationship with the number of appointments missed.
> 3. Neighbourhood does not seem to have a direct relationship with the number of appointments kept or missed.

## Limitations
The conclusions presented in the analysis should be considered with caution due to the following limitations:

1. The researcher's statistical knowledge is not comprehensive, potentially impacting the accuracy of the analysis.
2. The researcher's understanding of visualizations might be limited, leading to suboptimal visual representations.
3. Statistical tests and inferential methods were not applied, which could provide more robust results.
